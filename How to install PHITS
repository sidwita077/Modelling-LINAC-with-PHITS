Once you access to the JAEA drive, you have to get another password for downloading phits####.zipxxxx, where #### is the version ID.

The installation procedure is as follow:
  1. Rename phits####.zipxxxx to phits####.zip
  2. Extract the zip file with password "phits@JAEA"
  3. Read "readme-en.txt", "mac/README-eng.pdf", and "linux/readme-eng.txt" for the instructions for Windows, Mac, and Linux users, respectively.

If you have already installed PHITS, please rename (or delete) the old "phits" folder before the installation, and install the new version in the same folder.
